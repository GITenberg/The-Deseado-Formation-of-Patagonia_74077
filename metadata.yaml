description: '"The results of the Amherst Patagonian expedition were divided into
  two parts, the general features, together with the narrative, were reported in a
  separate volume entitled, ''Hunting extinct animals in the Patagonian pampas,''
  published in 1913. For this volume has been reserved the description of the material
  found and such conclusions as are directly derived from that material."--Preface.'
